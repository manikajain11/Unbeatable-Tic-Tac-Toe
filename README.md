# Unbeatable-Tic-Tac-Toe



This web application is created to provide the player with an Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe where the Frontend technologies used are HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

One of the notable features of this application is that there is no possibility for the player to ever win the game which works on the principle of the Minimax Algorithm.
As a professional chess player, this algorithm sees a few steps ahead and puts itself in the shoes of its opponent. It keeps playing ahead until it reaches a terminal arrangement of the board (terminal state) resulting in a tie, a win, or a loss. Once in a terminal state, the AI will assign an arbitrary positive score (+10) for a win, a negative score (-10) for a loss, or a neutral score (0) for a tie.
